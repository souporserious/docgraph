# {name}

A [topological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology) documentation generator for JavaScript with first-class support for React.

Built with [ts-morph](https://ts-morph.com/), [graphology](https://graphology.github.io/) [swc](https://swc.rs/), and [mdx](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx).

## Features

üï∏ Directed documentation graph

ü™∂ Minimal DSL for building rich documentation

üìù MDX for mixing Markdown and JSX

üñº Compile code examples

üì∞ Compile MDX to Markdown

üêá Quick links to source code for development and production

## Install

```bash
yarn add topodoc
```

```bash
npm install topodoc
```

## Usage

Start by importing the [[addProject]] helper:

```ts
import { addProject } from "topodoc"

const project = addProject()

project.addFile("README.md")
```

Now that we've added a project, we can start to add information to it and describe our system. Let's add a local `components` directory of React components:

```ts
const components = project.getSourceFiles("components/index.ts")
```

If you've chosen to [skip adding files automatically]([[#index.options.skip]]) or want to add specific files to your documentation graph, you can use the [[addSourceFiles]] helper:

```ts
const components = project.addSourceFiles("components/index.ts")
```

We can now look at any export and get the related information for it:

```ts
const component = components.getExport("Button")

component.references // array of references to this component
```

```ts
component.emit()
```

## Options

<Types source={topodoc} />
