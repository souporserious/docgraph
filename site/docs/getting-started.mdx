Greetings, this documentation is intended to help you learn the DocGraph library. In a few steps, we will have a graph of your project that can be used to produce documentation, visualizations, and much more. Let's get started!

<Warning>
  This library is a work in progress, and the API is subject to change. Currently only TypeScript
  and MDX files are supported. In the future, support will be considered for JavaScript and possibly
  other languages.
</Warning>

## Install

DocGraph comes with an interactive CLI to help you easily get set up and learn how everything works.

We'll start by installing the latest version of the library:

<Install />

Now, we can start the [[docgraph]] CLI:

```bash
docgraph start
```

Upon the first time running, it will prompt you to add the required configuration for your project.

Once setup, the server should now be running and have created `.data` directory.

## Gathering Data

DocGraph analyzes your codebase using the `tsconfig.json` file relative to where you run the CLI. This config can be overridden through a local [[docgraph.json]] file or through an additional tsconfig file. You may also specify [multiple entry points] to build an overall graph of how different projects interact with each other.

## Accessing Data

When we first started the CLI tool it created a `.data` directory. This contains all of the data that DocGraph has gathered from your codebase and will incremently update as you change and add additional files.

## Visualization

Since we have a graph of your project now, we can visualize it at:

```bash
docgraph start
```

This will start a new server where you can see a visualization of your project.

## Integrations

Now that we've seen the basic setup for reading and visualizing data, we can start integrating DocGraph with other tools like [NextJS] to build a documentation site or write a [simple Node script] that outputs the metrics we're interested in.
