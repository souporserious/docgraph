DocGraph is a library for generating a graph of all the metadata present in a given project or set of projects. It uses a technique called backlinking popularized by Roam Research to build a graph of prose content and type information.

The graph can be use for a multitude of purposes, including:

- Visualization of the project's relationships to MDX and exported declarations
- Finding the most relevant declarations in a project
- Get a high-level understanding of the project's structure and each relationship from your Design System to your how your React components are used throughout the project
