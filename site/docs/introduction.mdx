DocGraph is a library for generating a graph of all the metadata present in a given project or set of projects. It uses a technique called backlinking popularized by Roam Research to build a graph of prose content and type information.

The graph can be use for a multitude of purposes, including:

- Visualization of the project's relationships to MDX and exported declarations
- Finding the most relevant declarations in a project
- Get a high-level understanding of the project's structure and each relationship from your Design System to your how your React components are used throughout the project

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { Box, Stack } from "components"

export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Stack width="100%" height="100%" alignItems="center" justifyContent="center">
      <Box padding={16} backgroundColor="tomato" color="white">
        Hello Box
      </Box>
    </Stack>
  )
}
```
