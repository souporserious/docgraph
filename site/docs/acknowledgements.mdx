DocGraph is inspired by the rich ecosystem of open source projects from thriving community members and organizations.

Specifically, the following projects have inspired the DocGraph project:

## TS Morph

The DocGraph library wouldn't be possible without [TS Morph](https://ts-morph.com/) and adding better ergonomics to the TypeScript compiler. Thank you to [David Sherret](https://twitter.com/DavidSherret) for their continued work on this project.

## Canvas and Code Highlighting

The highlighting of canvas and code is inspired by [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/). And the implementation to achieve this is inspired by [Blocks UI](https://blocks-ui.com/), which uses a compiler to infer parent-child relationships.

## Playroom

Similarly, the responsive view and building of a better developer/designer experience were inspired by [Playroom](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom).

## Roam Research

[Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) for popularizing the backlinking technique and creating the double bracket syntax.

## Foam

[Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) for showcasing how backlinking can be applied to Markdown and a GUI system.

## DesignQL

[John Otander](https://twitter.com/4lpine)'s thoughts on [systems](https://johno.com/cartesian-product) and projects like [DesignQL](https://github.com/system-ui/designql) that uses GraphQL to understand relationships in a design system better.

## Design Graph

[Brent Jackson](https://twitter.com/jxnblk) for constantly iterating on [ideas](https://jxnblk.com/blog/design-graph/) and [tooling](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-docs) for design systems.

## Graph Docs CLI

[Matt Pocock](https://twitter.com/mpocock1) for exploring alternative ways to build documentation. Their [graph-docs-cli](https://github.com/mattpocock/graph-docs-cli) project was the catalyst to the core library and drew a connection for using backlinking to construct an entire graph of documentation from code and prose content.

## Contentlayer

Johannes for constantly sharing thoughts about ways to organize and manage content. [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) [gave confidence](https://twitter.com/schickling/status/1459779329257353218) to these ideas early on and continues to be an inspiration.

## MDX bundler

[MDX Bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler/) was the original bundler for the MDX files and has since been rewritten to use the [@mdx-js/esbuild](https://mdxjs.com/packages/esbuild/) plugin directly. The @docgraph/bundler would not be possible without this work.

## Next.js + MDX Enhanced

The [next-mdx-enhanced](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced) package was one of the first to provide a way to use MDX in Next.js more easily. Initially, an early implementation of DocGraph used a similar MDX loader for Webpack. However, this has since been consolidated into a single data-gathering pipeline.

## Code Blocks But Better

[Pedro Duarte](https://twitter.com/peduarte) for their thoughts on building better documentation through [interactive code blocks](https://ped.ro/writing/code-blocks-but-better). This article served as the inspiration for linking symbols from code to documentation.

## Nextra

[Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/) served as inspiration for the original data structure and using a colocated meta.json file for page order. Page order has since been changed and instead requires a numbered file structure for ordering.

## Rome

[Rome](https://rome.tools/) inspired to keep everything in one ecosystem to make it easier to maintain, more performant, and allow for quick iteration.

## JSX Info

[Brian](https://twitter.com/wavebeem) for their work on [jsx-info](https://github.com/wavebeem/jsx-info/). This library showcased how Babel can analyze usage across a project.

## Live editing

[Sid](https://twitter.com/siddharthkp) for constantly working on inspiring designer and developer tooling. Specifically, thank you for the fork of the editor link utility used in [babel-plugin-open-source](https://github.com/siddharthkp/babel-plugin-open-source).

## React Scanner

Similarly, thank you to [Misha Moroshko](https://twitter.com/moroshko) for their explorations with [react-scanner](https://github.com/moroshko/react-scanner) and how to analyze JSX usage better.

## Frame.io

Thank you to [Frame.io](https://frame.io/) for the opportunity to go deep into these problem spaces and explore better ways to document code.
